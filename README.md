# 42sh

Chapter III
Objectives
As a coder in training, there are moments, which marks your life. Forever.
42sh
is one
of those moments. Achieving this project is a milestone at 42.
This project is about writing the most stable and most complete
UNIX
shell possible.
You already know a lot of shells and each has its own features, from the humble
sh
avail-
able on every
UNIX
distribution in the world to the complete and complex
zsh
, which
many of you use without really knowing why. There are many other shells, such as
bash
,
csh
,
tcsh
,
ksh
,
ash
, etc.
42sh
is your first real shell. It is common practice for students
to choose to use a reference shell and try to replicate its basic behavior. This can be a
good strategy if you know the reasons why you chose that one shell specifically. Consider
this. If you choose
zsh
as reference, you will need to commit to a long and difficult quest,
even if highly instructive. Through this quest, you will learn humility and what it means
to work hard.
So what to do? We suggest you try a couple of shell first to get an idea of their suble
and twisted differences. However, don’t be fooled by the apparent simplicity of the
sh
shell. Recoding a thorough and stable
sh
is an achievement in itself. Forget about the
“moons and stars” shells. At the end, they won’t be able to do more than just a few
pipes and redirections.
The keyword here is “stability”. A humble and indestructible
42sh
is always better
than a kooky
42sh
with countless features that segfaults in unanticipated ways.  The
latter will be worth 0 in the end. Make sure that the
42sh
you submit is stable. I cannot
insist enough on that last point
